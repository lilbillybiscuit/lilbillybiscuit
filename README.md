Hello! I'm a student at Yale University (Class of 2026), majoring in computer science along the BS/MS program. I currently work with Yale Computer Society, YES Internships, and lead the RoomAdvisor team in bringing services to the Yale community. My current research is on LLM Agents and Code Generation, working under the direction of Mark Gerstein and Robert Tang.

In my free time, I love to sing with the Yale Glee Club, make short films, and explore creative outlets. I also love to support and help others, too! Whether it's being a teaching assistant or helping people realize their dreams, I'm committed to making the world a better place to be.

Feel free to explore my GitHub page, and please reach out if you would like to collaborate on something!
